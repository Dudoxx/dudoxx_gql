# Audio Field Access Security

This document outlines the security rules for the audio fields added to the `dudoxx.task` model as part of the audio recording extension.

## Access Rules

The access rules for the `dudoxx.task` model, including the new audio fields, are defined in the `ir.model.access.csv` file. The rules are as follows:

1. **User Access**
   - Record ID: `access_dudoxx_task_user`
   - Applied to: All users (base.group_user)
   - Permissions: Read, Write, Create, Unlink

2. **Manager Access**
   - Record ID: `access_dudoxx_task_manager`
   - Applied to: System administrators (base.group_system)
   - Permissions: Read, Write, Create, Unlink

## Field-specific Access

The `audio_data` and `audio_filename` fields inherit the access rights of the `dudoxx.task` model. This means:

- Regular users can read, write, create, and delete audio recordings associated with tasks.
- System administrators have full access to manage audio recordings and related data.

## Security Considerations

1. **Data Privacy**: As audio recordings may contain sensitive information, consider implementing additional access controls or encryption if required by your use case.

2. **File Size Limits**: To prevent potential abuse, consider implementing file size limits for audio uploads.

3. **Format Restrictions**: If specific audio formats are required or prohibited, implement validation checks in the model or controller logic.

4. **Audit Logging**: For sensitive operations involving audio data, consider implementing audit logging to track who accesses or modifies audio recordings.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Group-based Access**: If more granular control is needed, consider creating specific user groups for audio management.

2. **Field-level Access Rights**: Implement record rules or field-level access rights if certain users should have restricted access to audio data.

3. **Encryption**: For highly sensitive audio data, consider implementing encryption at rest and in transit.

Remember to regularly review and update these security measures as the module's requirements evolve.
