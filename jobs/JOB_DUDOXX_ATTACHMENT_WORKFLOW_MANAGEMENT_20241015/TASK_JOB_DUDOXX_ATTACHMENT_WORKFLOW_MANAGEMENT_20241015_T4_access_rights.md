TASK 4: Set Up Role-Based Access Groups and Security Rules

Defined user groups and permissions for managing the document workflow. The following groups and permissions were set up:

- Admin: Full access.
- Editor: Can submit documents for review.
- Reviewer: Can approve or reject documents.
- User: Read-only access.

Updated security/ir.model.access.csv for CRUD permissions and defined specific rules in security/access_rules.xml for each group.
