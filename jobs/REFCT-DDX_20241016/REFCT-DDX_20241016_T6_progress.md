# Task 6 Progress: Refactor Controllers

## Completed Actions
1. Created subdirectories in the `controllers` folder: `auth`, `core`, `transcription`, `api`, and `utils`.
2. Moved controller files to their respective subdirectories based on functionality.
3. Updated the `__init__.py` file in the `controllers` folder to reflect the new structure and import paths.

## Changes Made
- Reorganized controller files into appropriate subdirectories for better organization and maintainability.
- Grouped controllers by functionality (authentication, core business logic, transcription, API, and utilities).
- Updated import statements in `__init__.py` to reflect the new folder structure.

## Next Steps
1. Review the new controller structure to ensure all necessary files are included and properly referenced.
2. Update any other files in the project that may be importing these controllers directly.
3. Test the module to ensure that all controllers are working correctly with the new file structure.

## Notes
- The new structure should improve code organization and make it easier to maintain and extend the module's controllers in the future.
- Some files may require additional refactoring to fully adapt to the new structure, which will be addressed in subsequent tasks if needed.
