# Task 2 Progress: Refactor Python Models and Update Imports

## Completed Actions
1. Created subdirectories in the `models` folder: `core`, `transcription`, `ai`, `reports`, `auth`, and `utils`.
2. Moved model files into their respective subdirectories based on their functionality.
3. Updated the `__init__.py` file in the `models` folder to import from the new subdirectories.

## New Folder Structure
- models/
  - core/
  - transcription/
  - ai/
  - reports/
  - auth/
  - utils/
  - __init__.py

## Changes Made
- Reorganized model files into appropriate subdirectories for better organization and maintainability.
- Updated import statements in `__init__.py` to reflect the new folder structure.
- Grouped imports by category (core, transcription, AI, reports, auth, and utils) for improved readability.

## Next Steps
1. Review and update import statements in individual model files to ensure they are consistent with the new structure.
2. Test the module to ensure that all imports are working correctly and no functionality is broken.
3. Update any other files in the project that may be importing these models directly.

## Notes
- The new structure should improve code organization and make it easier to maintain and extend the module in the future.
- Some files may require additional refactoring to fully adapt to the new structure, which will be addressed in subsequent tasks.
