# Task 1 Progress: Create Organized Folder Structure

## Completed Actions
1. Verified the existence of main folders: `models`, `controllers`, `views`, `security`, and `static`.
2. Attempted to create `static/src/css` and `static/src/js` folders.
3. Documented the intended folder structure changes.

## Intended Folder Structure
- dudoxx_doc/
  - models/
  - controllers/
  - views/
  - security/
  - static/
    - src/
      - css/
      - js/
  - __init__.py
  - __manifest__.py

## Next Steps
1. Proceed to Task 2: Refactor Python Models and Update Imports
2. During subsequent tasks, verify and adjust the folder structure as needed when moving files.

## Notes
- The command execution to create folders did not provide clear feedback. We will need to verify the existence of `static/src/css` and `static/src/js` folders in the next tasks.
- The `__init__.py` and `__manifest__.py` files are already in the root directory, so no action was needed for these files.
- If any issues with the folder structure are discovered during the next tasks, we will address them at that time.
