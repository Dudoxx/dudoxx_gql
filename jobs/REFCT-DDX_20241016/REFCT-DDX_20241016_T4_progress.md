# Task 4 Progress: Reorganize Security and Access Rules

## Completed Actions
1. Created subdirectories in the `security` folder: `groups`, `access_rights`, and `other`.
2. Moved group-related XML files to the `groups` subdirectory.
3. Moved access rights files to the `access_rights` subdirectory.
4. Moved remaining relevant files to the `other` subdirectory.
5. Removed unnecessary `.off` files.
6. Updated the `__manifest__.py` file to reflect the new security file structure.

## New Security Folder Structure
- security/
  - groups/
  - access_rights/
  - other/

## Changes Made
- Reorganized security files into appropriate subdirectories for better organization and maintainability.
- Updated file paths in `__manifest__.py` to reflect the new folder structure.
- Removed outdated or unnecessary files (`.off` files).
- Grouped security files by type (groups, access rights, and other) for improved readability and easier maintenance.

## Next Steps
1. Review the new security structure to ensure all necessary files are included and properly referenced.
2. Test the module to ensure that all security settings and access rules are working correctly with the new file structure.
3. Update any other files in the project that may be referencing these security files directly.

## Notes
- The new structure should improve code organization and make it easier to maintain and extend the module's security settings in the future.
- Some files may require additional refactoring to fully adapt to the new structure, which will be addressed in subsequent tasks if needed.
