2. **Testing**: Thoroughly test all CRUD operations and main functionalities to ensure the refactoring hasn't introduced any bugs.
3. **Documentation Update**: Update any existing documentation to reflect the new structure and any changes in functionality.
4. **Code Review**: Conduct a final code review to ensure all changes align with the project's coding standards and best practices.
5. **Deployment Planning**: Plan for how these changes will be deployed to existing installations, considering any necessary migration scripts.

## Conclusion
This refactoring process has significantly improved the structure and organization of the `dudoxx_doc` module. The new structure should lead to easier maintenance, better readability, and improved extensibility for future development. It is crucial to follow through with the next steps, particularly thorough testing, to ensure that all functionality remains intact and performs as expected in the refactored module.
