## Import Analysis

### Python Standard Library Imports
- From `typing`:
  - `List`
  - `Dict`
  - `Any`
  - `Tuple`

Status: These are standard Python library imports and are consistent.

### Odoo Framework Imports
- From `odoo`:
  - `models`
  - `fields`
  - `api`

Status: These are standard Odoo framework imports and are consistent with Odoo development practices.

### Python Standard Library Imports
- `logging`

Status: This is a standard Python library import and is consistent.

## Local Imports
There are no local imports in this file.

## Overall Status
All imports in this file are from standard Python libraries or the Odoo framework. There are no local or third-party imports that need to be verified against the project structure.

## Recommendations
1. The imports are well-organized and follow good practices.
2. Consider grouping the imports more specifically:
   ```python
   from typing import List, Dict, Any, Tuple
   import logging

   from odoo import models, fields, api
   ```
   This separates standard library imports from Odoo-specific imports, which is a common convention in Python.

3. If there are any project-specific utilities or modules that could be useful for this dashboard (e.g., from the `utils` folder), consider importing and using them to enhance functionality or improve code organization.

4. The absence of local imports suggests that this module is relatively self-contained. However, it might be worth reviewing if any functionality could be abstracted into utility functions that could be shared across other parts of the project.
