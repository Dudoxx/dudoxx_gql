# Task 2: Externalize Functions for Reusability

## Progress Log

1. Updated `stateUtils.js`:
   - Added `setDefaultLanguage` function

2. Updated `audioUtils.js`:
   - Added `loadRecording` function
   - Added `saveRecording` function

3. Updated `uiUtils.js`:
   - Added `confirmDialog` function

4. Updated `dudoxx_recorder.js`:
   - Updated imports to include new utility functions
   - Replaced inline implementations with calls to externalized functions
   - Removed redundant code now handled by utility functions

## Next Steps

- Review the changes to ensure all functionality is preserved
- Update any related documentation or comments
- Test the refactored code to ensure it works as expected
- Proceed with Task 3: Update XML Template for Widget in `dudoxx_recorder`

## Notes

- The refactoring improves code organization and reusability
- Some functions may need further optimization or error handling
- Consider adding unit tests for the new utility functions in the future
