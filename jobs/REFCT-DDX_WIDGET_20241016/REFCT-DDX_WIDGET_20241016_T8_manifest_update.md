# Task 8: Update `__manifest__.py` with New Asset Paths

## Progress Log

1. Updated the `__manifest__.py` file with the following changes:
   - Incremented the version number from 0.1 to 0.2 to reflect the recent changes.
   - Added new JS file paths for the refactored Dudoxx Recorder widget:
     - "/dudoxx_doc/static/src/js/dudoxx_recorder/components/RecordingControls.js"
     - "/dudoxx_doc/static/src/js/dudoxx_recorder/services/WebSocketService.js"
   - Ensured all existing paths for the Dudoxx Recorder widget components and utilities are correct.

2. Verified that all necessary asset paths are included in the `web.assets_backend` list.

3. Kept the existing structure for other assets, including XML, SCSS, CSS, and library JS files.

## Next Steps

- Test the module installation and update process to ensure all assets are correctly loaded.
- Verify that the Dudoxx Recorder widget functions correctly with the updated asset paths.
- If any issues are found during testing, make necessary adjustments to the asset paths or file locations.
- Proceed with Task 9: Commit and Push Changes to Git.

## Notes

- The updated `__manifest__.py` file now correctly reflects the new structure of the Dudoxx Recorder widget.
- It's important to test the module thoroughly after these changes to ensure all assets are loaded correctly.
- Consider adding a note in the module's documentation about the recent refactoring and any potential impacts on existing installations.
