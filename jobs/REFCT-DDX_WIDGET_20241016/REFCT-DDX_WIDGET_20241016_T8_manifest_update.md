# Task 8: Update `__manifest__.py` with New Assets Paths

## Changes Made

1. Reviewed the existing `__manifest__.py` file.
2. Confirmed that all JavaScript, XML, and CSS files used by the `dudoxx_recorder` widget are included in the assets paths.
3. Verified that the paths reflect the restructured folder organization.

## Asset Paths Included

The following asset paths related to the `dudoxx_recorder` widget are now included in the `__manifest__.py` file:

### XML files
- "/dudoxx_doc/static/src/xml/dudoxx_audio_recorder.xml"
- "/dudoxx_doc/static/src/xml/dudoxx_recorder.xml"

### CSS files
- "/dudoxx_doc/static/src/css/dud_recorder.css"

### JS files
- "/dudoxx_doc/static/src/js/dudoxx_recorder/dudoxx_recorder.js"
- "/dudoxx_doc/static/src/js/dudoxx_recorder/audioUtils.js"
- "/dudoxx_doc/static/src/js/dudoxx_recorder/webSocketUtils.js"
- "/dudoxx_doc/static/src/js/dudoxx_recorder/waveSurferUtils.js"
- "/dudoxx_doc/static/src/js/dudoxx_recorder/stateUtils.js"
- "/dudoxx_doc/static/src/js/dudoxx_recorder/uiUtils.js"
- "/dudoxx_doc/static/src/js/dudoxx_audio_recorder.js"
- "/dudoxx_doc/static/src/js/DudoxxAudioRecorder.js"

## Conclusion

The `__manifest__.py` file has been successfully updated to include all necessary asset paths for the refactored `dudoxx_recorder` widget. This ensures that Odoo will properly load all required files for the widget to function correctly.

## Next Steps

1. Test the module to ensure all assets are loading correctly.
2. If any issues are found during testing, review and adjust the asset paths as needed.
3. Proceed with the next task in the refactoring process.
