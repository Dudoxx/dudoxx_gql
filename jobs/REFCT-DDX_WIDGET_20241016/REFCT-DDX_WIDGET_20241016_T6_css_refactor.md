# CSS Refactoring for Dudoxx Recorder Widget

## Changes Made

1. **Class Naming Convention**: 
   - All class selectors have been prefixed with `ddx_recorder_` to ensure modularity and prevent conflicts with other styles.

2. **Color Scheme**:
   - Updated colors to better integrate with Odoo's default theme.
   - Primary button color changed to green (#28a745) for better visibility and consistency.

3. **Layout and Spacing**:
   - Adjusted padding and margins for improved readability and layout consistency.
   - Reduced border-radius values for a more subtle, modern look.

4. **Typography**:
   - Standardized font sizes and weights for better hierarchy.
   - Added line-height to improve readability of transcription text.

5. **Animations**:
   - Renamed the keyframe animation to `ddx-recorder-blink-border` to avoid potential conflicts.

6. **Modularity**:
   - Grouped related styles together for easier maintenance.
   - Removed redundant styles and consolidated where possible.

7. **Responsive Design**:
   - Maintained max-width for the container to ensure responsiveness on different screen sizes.

8. **Accessibility**:
   - Improved color contrast for better readability and accessibility.

## Integration with Odoo Backend

- The refactored CSS now uses color values that are more aligned with Odoo's default color scheme, ensuring a seamless integration with the backend layout.
- Box shadows and border-radius values have been adjusted to match Odoo's design language more closely.
- The overall structure of the widget has been maintained, but with improved spacing and layout that should work well within Odoo's UI.

## Next Steps

- Test the refactored CSS within the Odoo environment to ensure proper integration and functionality.
- Consider adding responsive breakpoints if needed for better mobile compatibility.
- Review with the team to ensure the new styles meet project requirements and Odoo's design guidelines.
