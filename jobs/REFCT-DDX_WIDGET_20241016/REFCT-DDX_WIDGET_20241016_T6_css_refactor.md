# Task 6: Refactor CSS in `dud_recorder.css`

## Progress Log

1. Refactored the CSS file to improve modularity and maintainability:
   - Introduced CSS custom properties (variables) for common values.
   - Ensured consistent use of the `ddx_recorder_` prefix for all class names.
   - Grouped related styles together for better organization.
   - Optimized selectors for improved performance.

2. Enhanced dark mode compatibility:
   - Used CSS variables to easily switch between light and dark mode styles.
   - Ensured all components have appropriate dark mode styles.

3. Added styles for new components:
   - Included styles for the WaveSurfer component.
   - Added styles for the RecordingControls component.

4. Improved overall consistency and readability of the CSS.

## Next Steps

- Review the refactored CSS to ensure all components are styled correctly.
- Test the styles in both light and dark modes to verify compatibility.
- Update any related documentation or comments.
- Proceed with Task 7: Update Documentation.

## Notes

- The refactored CSS now uses CSS custom properties, making it easier to maintain and modify in the future.
- The use of the `ddx_recorder_` prefix for all class names helps prevent conflicts with other styles in the Odoo ecosystem.
- Some further optimization might be possible, especially in terms of responsiveness for different screen sizes.
