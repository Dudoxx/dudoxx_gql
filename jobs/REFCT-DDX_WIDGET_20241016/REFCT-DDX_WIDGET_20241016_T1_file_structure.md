# Dudoxx Recorder Widget File Structure Changes

## Task ID: REFCT-DDX_WIDGET_20241016_T1

### Objective
Restructure widget files for better organization.

### Steps Completed
1. Created a new folder `./dudoxx_doc/static/src/js/dudoxx_recorder/`.
2. Moved `dudoxx_recorder.js` into the newly created `./dudoxx_recorder/` folder.

### File Structure Changes
```
dudoxx_doc/
└── static/
    └── src/
        └── js/
            └── dudoxx_recorder/
                └── dudoxx_recorder.js
```

### Notes
- The `dudoxx_recorder.xml` file did not require any changes as it does not directly reference the JavaScript file.
- Further updates to import statements or asset declarations may be needed in other files (e.g., `__manifest__.py`) to reflect this new structure.

### Next Steps
1. Update import statements in any files that reference `dudoxx_recorder.js`.
2. Update asset declarations in `__manifest__.py` to reflect the new file location.
3. Proceed with refactoring the JavaScript code for improved modularity and reusability.
