# Task 1: Initialize and Organize Project Structure for Widget Refactoring

## Progress Log

1. Created the following folder structure under `./dudoxx_doc/static/src/js/dudoxx_recorder/`:
   - components/
   - services/
   - utils/

2. Moved the following files to their respective folders:
   - `dudoxx_recorder.js` to `components/`
   - `audioUtils.js`, `stateUtils.js`, `uiUtils.js`, `waveSurferUtils.js`, and `webSocketUtils.js` to `utils/`

3. The `services/` folder is currently empty and ready for future service-related files.

## Next Steps

- Review the contents of each file to ensure they are in the correct location.
- Update import statements in the files to reflect the new folder structure.
- Proceed with Task 2: Externalize Functions for Reusability.

## Notes

- The new folder structure provides better organization and modularity for the dudoxx_recorder widget.
- This structure will make it easier to maintain and extend the widget's functionality in the future.
