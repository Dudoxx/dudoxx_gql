# Task 4: Update Widget Usage in Form Views

## Progress Log

1. Reviewed the `vocal_recording.xml` file containing the form view for `dudoxx_doc.vocal_recording` model.
2. Identified the existing usage of the `dudoxx_recorder` widget in the form view.
3. Updated the widget usage to include the `t-ref="waveformRef"` attribute:
   ```xml
   <field name="audio_file" filename="audio_file_name" widget="dudoxx_recorder"
          options="{'model': 'dudoxx_doc.vocal_recording', 'transcription': 'transcription_realtime', 'voice': 'audio_file'}"
          t-ref="waveformRef"/>
   ```
4. Verified that the widget options are correctly set and align with our refactored JavaScript code.

## Next Steps

- Test the updated form view to ensure the widget functions correctly with the new changes.
- Update any other views or templates that may be using the `dudoxx_recorder` widget.
- Proceed with Task 5: Refactor JavaScript and XML Template for Improved Modularity.

## Notes

- The `t-ref="waveformRef"` attribute was added to match the reference used in the JavaScript code.
- The existing options for the widget seem to align well with our refactored code, so no further changes were needed there.
- It's important to test this change thoroughly to ensure the widget still functions correctly within the Odoo form view context.
