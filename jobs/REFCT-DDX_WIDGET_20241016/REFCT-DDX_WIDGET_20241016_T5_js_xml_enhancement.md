# Task 5: Refactor JavaScript and XML Template for Improved Modularity

## Progress Log

1. Created a separate RecordingControls component for the recording buttons and logic.
2. Moved WebSocket logic into a separate WebSocketService.
3. Refactored the main DudoxxVoiceRecorder component to use the new RecordingControls component and WebSocketService.
4. Updated the XML template to reflect the new component structure.
5. Ensured all utility functions are properly imported and used.

## Next Steps

- Review the changes to ensure all functionality is preserved.
- Update any related documentation or comments.
- Test the refactored code to ensure it works as expected.
- Proceed with Task 6: Refactor CSS in `dud_recorder.css`.

## Notes

- The refactoring improves code organization and modularity.
- The RecordingControls component can be reused in other parts of the application if needed.
- The WebSocketService encapsulates all WebSocket-related logic, making it easier to maintain and extend.
- Some further optimization might be possible, especially in error handling and state management.
