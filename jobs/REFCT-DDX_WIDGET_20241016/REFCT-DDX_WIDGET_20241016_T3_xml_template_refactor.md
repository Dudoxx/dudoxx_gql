# Task 3: Update XML Template for Widget in `dudoxx_recorder`

## Progress Log

1. Updated the XML template to align with the refactored JavaScript code:
   - Added `t-ref="waveformRef"` to the audio visualizer div.
   - Updated the mic select to use `t-ref="micSelect"`.
   - Added forward and reverse audio buttons with corresponding `t-on-click` handlers.
   - Updated the transcriptions textarea to use `t-ref="transcriptionsRef"`.

2. Ensured all event handlers and state references are correct and consistent with the JavaScript code.

3. Maintained the overall structure and functionality of the template while incorporating the new changes.

## Next Steps

- Review the updated template in conjunction with the JavaScript code to ensure full compatibility.
- Test the widget to verify that all functionality works as expected with the new template.
- Proceed with Task 4: Update Widget Usage in Form Views.

## Notes

- The updated template now better reflects the modular structure of the refactored JavaScript code.
- Some minor adjustments to class names and element IDs were made for consistency.
- The language selection options were kept as-is, but may need future review for completeness or customization.
