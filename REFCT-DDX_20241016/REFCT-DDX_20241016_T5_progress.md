# Task 5 Progress: Update and Organize Static Assets (CSS and JavaScript)

## Completed Actions
1. Moved misplaced JavaScript files to the appropriate `static/src/js` directory.
2. Verified that all CSS files are in the `static/src/css` directory.
3. Verified that all JavaScript files are in the `static/src/js` directory.
4. Verified that all image files are in the `static/src/img` directory.
5. Updated the `__manifest__.py` file to reflect the new file structure for static assets.

## Changes Made
- Reorganized static asset files into appropriate subdirectories for better organization and maintainability.
- Updated file paths in `__manifest__.py` to reflect the new folder structure.
- Grouped static assets by type (XML, SCSS, CSS, JS, and images) in the `assets` section of `__manifest__.py`.

## Next Steps
1. Review the new static asset structure to ensure all necessary files are included and properly referenced.
2. Test the module to ensure that all static assets are loading correctly with the new file structure.
3. Update any other files in the project that may be referencing these static assets directly.

## Notes
- The new structure should improve code organization and make it easier to maintain and extend the module's static assets in the future.
- Some files may require additional refactoring to fully adapt to the new structure, which will be addressed in subsequent tasks if needed.
