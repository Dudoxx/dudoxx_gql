# Task 7 Progress: Optimize `__manifest__.py` and `__init__.py` Files

## Completed Actions
1. Updated `__manifest__.py` file:
   - Reorganized the `data` list to reflect the new folder structure
   - Updated paths for security files, views, and other data files
   - Adjusted the `assets` section to include files from the new directory structure

2. Updated `__init__.py` file:
   - Organized imports based on the new subdirectories for models and controllers
   - Imported specific modules from each subdirectory to maintain clear structure

## Changes Made
- Restructured imports in `__init__.py` to reflect the new module organization
- Updated file paths in `__manifest__.py` to match the new folder structure
- Ensured that all necessary files are included and properly referenced

## Next Steps
1. Review the changes made to ensure all necessary files are imported and referenced correctly
2. Test the module to ensure that all components are working correctly with the new file structure
3. Update any other files in the project that may be affected by these changes

## Notes
- The new structure should improve code organization and make it easier to maintain and extend the module in the future
- Some files may require additional refactoring to fully adapt to the new structure, which will be addressed in the final code review and cleanup task
