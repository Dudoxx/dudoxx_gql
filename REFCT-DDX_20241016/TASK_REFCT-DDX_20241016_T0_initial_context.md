# Initial Context Documentation for `dudoxx_doc` Module

## Current Structure Overview

The `dudoxx_doc` module has the following main components:

### Root Files
- `__init__.py`
- `__manifest__.py`
- Various configuration and README files (e.g., `INSTALL.md`, `README.md`, `requirements.txt`)

### Models
Located in the `models/` directory, including:
- Base models: `res_users.py`, `res_company.py`, `res_config_settings.py`
- Custom models: `clinic_model.py`, `doctor_model.py`, `patient_model.py`, `consultation.py`
- Report-related models: `medical_report.py`, `report_template_model.py`, `pdf_report_model.py`
- AI and NLP models: `openai_dudoxx_llm.py`, `litellm_dudoxx_llm.py`, `patient_rag_chroma.py`
- Transcription models: `audio_transcriber_*.py`, `vocal_recording.py`

### Controllers
Located in the `controllers/` directory, including:
- Authentication: `auth.py`, `authentication.py`
- Main controllers: `controllers.py`, `dudoxx_client.py`, `odoo_client.py`
- Transcription: `realtime_transcriber.py`, `rt_deepgram.py`, `rt_gladia.py`

### Views
Views are not explicitly visible in the provided structure, but they are likely defined within XML files in the `views/` directory.

### Security
Located in the `security/` directory, including:
- Access rights: `ir.model.access.csv`, `consolidated_access_rights.xml`
- Security groups: Various `group_dudoxx_*.xml` files

### Data
Located in the `data/` directory, including:
- XML files for various medical specialties and report templates
- Feature flags and sequences

### Static Assets
Located in the `static/` directory, including:
- JavaScript files: `dudoxx_audio_recorder.js`
- Potentially other CSS and image files (not visible in the truncated list)

### Utilities
Located in the `utils/` directory, including:
- Various Python scripts for data population, RPC usage, and helper functions
- Audio and image files for testing or documentation

## Key Areas for Refactoring

1. **Model Organization**: The `models/` directory contains a mix of core business logic, AI/NLP functionalities, and transcription services. These could be further organized into subdirectories.

2. **Controller Structure**: The `controllers/` directory could benefit from grouping related functionalities (e.g., authentication, transcription).

3. **Security File Consolidation**: The security directory contains multiple files for different groups and access rights. These could potentially be consolidated for easier management.

4. **Static Asset Management**: The structure of static assets is not clear from the truncated list. Ensuring proper organization of JS, CSS, and image files would be beneficial.

5. **Utility Scripts**: The `utils/` directory contains a mix of scripts, documentation, and media files. Separating these into more specific categories could improve maintainability.

6. **Documentation**: While there are various README and documentation files, centralizing and structuring the documentation could enhance its usability.

7. **Data Files**: The `data/` directory contains numerous XML files. Grouping these by functionality or module could improve clarity.

## Next Steps

1. Create a more organized folder structure as outlined in Task 1.
2. Begin refactoring models, views, and controllers into their respective new locations.
3. Consolidate and organize security files for improved manageability.
4. Review and reorganize static assets and utility scripts.
5. Update import statements and references throughout the module to reflect the new structure.

This initial context provides a foundation for the progressive refactoring tasks that follow, ensuring that each step builds upon the last to create a more maintainable and organized `dudoxx_doc` module.
