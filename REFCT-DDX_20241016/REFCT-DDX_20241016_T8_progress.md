# Task 8 Progress: Final Code Review and Cleanup

## Completed Actions
1. Reviewed and updated `__init__.py`:
   - Organized imports based on the new subdirectories for models and controllers
   - Ensured all necessary modules are imported

2. Reviewed and updated `__manifest__.py`:
   - Updated data file paths to reflect the new folder structure
   - Ensured all view files are correctly referenced with their new paths
   - Verified that all necessary static files are included in the `assets` section

3. Performed a manual code review of key files

## Changes Made
- Restructured imports in `__init__.py` to reflect the new module organization
- Updated file paths in `__manifest__.py` to match the new folder structure
- Ensured that all necessary files are included and properly referenced

## Next Steps
1. Run linting tools on the entire codebase to ensure code quality and consistency
2. Test CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for all major models in the module
3. Review the module's functionality to ensure all features are working as expected after the refactoring
4. Address any issues or inconsistencies found during the review process

## Notes
- The new structure should improve code organization and make it easier to maintain and extend the module in the future
- Some files may require additional refactoring or testing to fully adapt to the new structure
- It's important to thoroughly test the module to ensure that all functionalities are working correctly with the new file structure
