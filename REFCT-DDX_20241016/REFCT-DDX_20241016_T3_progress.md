# Task 3 Progress: Refactor Views and Organize XML Files

## Completed Actions
1. Created subdirectories in the `views` folder: `core`, `reports`, `settings`, `auth`, and `utils`.
2. Moved XML view files into their respective subdirectories based on their functionality.
3. Updated the `__manifest__.py` file to reflect the new folder structure and file paths.

## New Views Folder Structure
- views/
  - core/
  - reports/
  - settings/
  - auth/
  - utils/

## Changes Made
- Reorganized XML view files into appropriate subdirectories for better organization and maintainability.
- Updated file paths in `__manifest__.py` to reflect the new folder structure.
- Grouped views by category (core, reports, settings, auth, and utils) for improved readability and easier maintenance.

## Next Steps
1. Review and update any import statements or references to these XML files in Python code, if necessary.
2. Test the module to ensure that all views are loading correctly with the new file structure.
3. Update any other files in the project that may be referencing these view files directly.

## Notes
- The new structure should improve code organization and make it easier to maintain and extend the module's views in the future.
- Some files may require additional refactoring to fully adapt to the new structure, which will be addressed in subsequent tasks if needed.
