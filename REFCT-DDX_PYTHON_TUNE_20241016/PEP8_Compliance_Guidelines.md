# PEP-8 Compliance Guidelines for dudoxx_doc Module

## Introduction
This document outlines the guidelines for maintaining PEP-8 compliance in the dudoxx_doc module. Following these guidelines will ensure consistent code style and improve overall code readability and maintainability.

## General Guidelines

1. **Line Length**: 
   - Limit all lines to a maximum of 79 characters for code.
   - For longer texts (docstrings or comments), limit lines to 72 characters.

2. **Indentation**: 
   - Use 4 spaces per indentation level.
   - Never mix tabs and spaces.

3. **Imports**:
   - Group imports in the following order:
     1. Standard library imports
     2. Related third-party imports
     3. Local application/library specific imports
   - Use separate lines for each import.

4. **Whitespace**:
   - Use blank lines to separate functions and classes, and larger chunks of code inside functions.
   - Avoid extraneous whitespace within parentheses, brackets or braces.

5. **Naming Conventions**:
   - Classes: Use CapWords convention (e.g., `PatientModel`)
   - Functions and Variables: Use lowercase with underscores (e.g., `calculate_age`)
   - Constants: Use all capital letters with underscores (e.g., `MAX_PATIENTS`)

6. **Comments and Docstrings**:
   - Use docstrings for all public modules, functions, classes, and methods.
   - Use inline comments sparingly, only when necessary to explain complex logic.

7. **Error Handling**:
   - Use try/except blocks judiciously, catching specific exceptions when possible.

## Specific Guidelines for dudoxx_doc

1. **Model Definitions**:
   - Place field definitions at the top of the model class, followed by computed fields, then methods.
   - Group related fields together.

2. **Controller Methods**:
   - Use descriptive names for route methods.
   - Include type hints for all parameters and return values.

3. **API Methods**:
   - Always include proper error handling and logging.
   - Use consistent response formats across all API endpoints.

4. **Computed Fields**:
   - Use clear and descriptive names for computed fields.
   - Include detailed docstrings explaining the computation logic.

5. **Long Method Refactoring**:
   - If a method exceeds 50 lines, consider breaking it into smaller, more focused methods.

6. **Constants**:
   - Move all magic numbers and strings to a centralized `constants.py` file.

7. **Type Hinting**:
   - Use type hints consistently across all new code and when modifying existing code.

## Tools and Enforcement

1. **Linting**: 
   - Use flake8 for linting. Run `flake8 ./dudoxx_doc` before committing code.

2. **Formatting**: 
   - Use Black as the code formatter. Run `black ./dudoxx_doc` before committing code.

3. **Pre-commit Hooks**: 
   - Set up pre-commit hooks to run flake8 and Black automatically before each commit.

4. **Continuous Integration**: 
   - Include PEP-8 compliance checks in the CI pipeline.

## Code Review Process

1. Reviewers should use the provided code review checklist to ensure PEP-8 compliance.
2. Any violations of these guidelines should be addressed before merging code.
3. Regular team discussions should be held to refine and update these guidelines as needed.

By following these guidelines, we can maintain a high standard of code quality and consistency throughout the dudoxx_doc module.
