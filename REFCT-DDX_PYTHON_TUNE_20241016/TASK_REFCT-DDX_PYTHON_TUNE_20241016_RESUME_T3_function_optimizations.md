4. **Import Optimization**: Removed unused imports and reorganized import statements for better clarity.
5. **Comprehensive Docstrings**: Added more detailed docstrings for classes and methods, following the Google style guide.
6. **Constants for Repeated Values**: Introduced constants for repeated string literals and HTTP status codes, reducing the risk of typos and improving maintainability.
7. **Method Refactoring**: Refactored some methods to be more concise and focused, improving overall code structure.
8. **Consistent Error Handling**: Standardized error handling and logging practices across the file.

### Optimizations Implemented:

1. **Custom Exception Class**: Implemented a `DudoxxAPIException` for more specific error handling related to API operations.
2. **Base Client Class**: Created a `BaseClient` class to share common functionality between `DudoxxDocClient` and `DudoxxOdooClient`, promoting code reuse and consistency.
3. **Retry Mechanism**: Implemented a retry mechanism with exponential backoff in the `_make_request` method to handle transient network issues.
4. **F-string Usage**: Replaced older string formatting methods with f-strings for improved readability and performance.
5. **Comprehensive Docstrings**: Added detailed docstrings for all classes and methods, improving code documentation and maintainability.
6. **Logging Implementation**: Replaced print statements with proper logging for better debugging and monitoring capabilities.
7. **Consistent Type Hinting**: Used type hints more consistently throughout the file, including for method return types.
8. **API Key Refresh**: Implemented a `refresh_api_key` method to handle potential API key expiration scenarios.
9. **Session Management**: Used a `requests.Session` object for better connection management and potential performance improvements.
10. **Example Usage**: Added an example usage section with proper error handling to demonstrate how to use the client classes effectively.

### Impact:

These optimizations enhance the overall quality of the code by improving:
- Readability: Through consistent type hinting, comprehensive docstrings, and better code structure.
- Maintainability: By using constants, improving error handling, and standardizing coding practices.
- Performance: Through optimized string operations, better resource management, and implementation of retry mechanisms.
- Security: By removing hardcoded sensitive information and using environment variables.
- Consistency: By applying similar optimization techniques across different files in the project.
- Error Handling: By implementing custom exceptions and standardized error handling practices.
- Debugging: By enhancing logging capabilities throughout the codebase.
