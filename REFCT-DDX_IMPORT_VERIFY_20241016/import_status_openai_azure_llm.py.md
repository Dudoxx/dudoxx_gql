# Import Status: openai_azure_llm.py

## File Location
`dudoxx_doc/models/ai/openai_azure_llm.py`

## Import Analysis

### Python Standard Library Imports
- `json`
- `logging`
- `os`
- `time`
- From `threading`: `Semaphore`
- From `typing`: `Any`, `Dict`, `List`, `Optional`, `Tuple`

Status: All these imports are from the Python standard library and are consistent.

### Third-Party Library Imports
- `openai`
- From `dotenv`: `load_dotenv`
- From `openai.types.chat`: `ChatCompletion`

Status: These are third-party library imports. The project should ensure that these libraries are properly installed and their versions are compatible with the code.

## Local Imports
There are no local imports in this file.

## Overall Status
The imports in this file are from the Python standard library and third-party libraries. There are no local imports that need to be verified against the project structure.

## Recommendations
1. Ensure that the `openai` and `python-dotenv` libraries are listed in the project's requirements.txt file with the correct versions.
2. The imports are well-organized, with standard library imports at the top, followed by third-party imports.
3. Consider adding type hints for the `openai` import if not already present.
4. The use of `load_dotenv("../../../boiler.env")` suggests that there's an environment file three directories up from the current file. Ensure that this path is correct and that the file exists.
5. If there are any project-specific utilities or modules that could be useful for handling Azure OpenAI API interactions (e.g., from the `utils` folder), consider importing and using them to enhance functionality or improve code organization.

## Additional Notes
- The module defines two main classes: `AzurePoolLLM` and `AzureLLMPrompter`.
- The code follows good practices by using type hints, docstrings, and proper error handling.
- The use of environment variables (loaded from a .env file) for configuration is a good practice for security and flexibility.
- The module includes a `__main__` section for testing or demonstration purposes, which is helpful for development and debugging.
